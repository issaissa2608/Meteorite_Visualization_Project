Meteorite Visualization Project
This project is a data visualization application that displays information about meteorites using a map-based interface. It retrieves meteorite data from the NASA Open Data API and represents meteorite landings and finds as interactive markers on a map. The markers are color-coded based on the mass of the meteorites, and additional information is displayed in pop-up windows.
  
ETL
Extract
Data sourced from the NASA Open Data API
Transform
Data cleaned and transformed by using Python Jupyter Notebook.  
Load
This project used MongoDB Compass to load transformed data in to database. 

Features
•	Data Retrieval: The application retrieves meteorite data from the NASA Open Data API.
•	Marker Representation: Meteorite landings and finds are represented as markers on a map.
•	Color Coding: The markers are color-coded based on the mass of the meteorites.
•	Interactive Pop-ups: Clicking on a marker displays a pop-up with information about the meteorite, including its name and mass.
•	Base Map Layers: The application offers two base map layers: Street Map and Topographic Map.
•	Legend: A legend is provided to explain the color scale used for the meteorite mass.

Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/issaissa2608/Meteorite_Visualization_Project.git 
2.	Navigate to the project directory: cd Meteorite_Visualization_Project
3.	Open the index.html file in a web browser. 
4.	The map will load, displaying meteorite markers at their respective locations.
5.	Interact with the map by zooming in/out and dragging to explore different regions.
6.	Click on a marker to view more information about the meteorite.
7.	Click on file:///Users/gdofficial1/Downloads/PROJECT%203C/index.html to view map in browser.

Dependencies
This project utilizes the following libraries:
•	d3.js: A JavaScript library for data visualization.
•	Leaflet.js: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
•	Request: The library is used for making HTTP request to the API. It sends the GET request to the specified URL and retrieve the data.
•	Json: the library is used for working with JSON data. It is used to extract the JSON response from the API and parse it into a python data structure.

Additional Resources
For more information about meteorites and related topics, you may find the following resources helpful:
•	NASA Open Data Portal: Access more datasets and APIs provided by NASA.
•	Meteoritical Society: Learn more about meteorites, meteorite classification, and research in the field.
•	International Meteor Organization: Explore meteor showers, meteor observations, and global meteor-related activities.
